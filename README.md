## Cost Optimization

The extension is designed to minimize API costs:

- **Direct Field Mapping**: Common fields (name, email, etc.) are filled directly from your profile
- **Response Caching**: Similar questions reuse cached AI responses
- **Efficient Model**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo instead of more expensive models
- **Limited Response Length**: AI responses are capped to reduce token usage

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All your data is stored locally in Chrome's encrypted storage
- **No External Servers**: Only communicates with OpenAI's API
